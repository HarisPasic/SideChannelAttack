[PULP FICTION]
Ezekiel 25:17. "The path of the righteous man  is beset  on  all  sides  by the
Inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men. Blessed  is  he  who, in
The name of charity and good will, shepherds  the  weak  through the  valley of
Darkness, for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost Children.
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious  Anger  those
who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers. And you will know My name is the 
Lord when I lay my vengeance upon thee."
